## User

Please find words that include "AI" but do not mean "artificial intelligence" from the attached file.

## Assistant (gpt-4o)


Please remember to search the user's documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.


## Assistant (gpt-4o)

From the provided file, here are some examples of words containing "AI" that are unrelated to "artificial intelligence":

1. **SAILS** (as in "Project SAILS")
2. **WebAIM** (as in "Director, WebAIM")
3. **CampusEAI** (as in "CampusEAI IP Television Service")
4. **MAIS** (as in "University of Michigan-MAIS Strategic Plan")
5. **Kuali** (as in "Kuali Ready International Product Manager")
6. **FAIT** (as in "FAIT Panel E13.pdf")
7. **RAI** (as in "ERAI - EUNIS Research and Analysis Initiative")
8. **SAIT** (as in "SAIT Constituent Group")
9. **FAE** (as in "Functional Accessibility Evaluator")
10. **NAIR** (likely as part of another acronym)

Would you like these words extracted and categorized further?

## User

Please extract more.

If you'd like, I can create a more refined or categorized list, or extract specific additional examples from the text. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

## User

I made the following script to count html files with the words "AI" at least once. Please rewrite the code by python3 and exclude the words that do not mean "artificial intelligence" listed above:

~~~ 1_count_words_2024_1221.sh 
#!/bin/bash
for i in {2000..2024}; do
    cd "html_${i}"
    echo -n "$i,"
    #grep "AI" *.html
    grep -l "AI" *.html | wc | awk '{print $1}'
    cd -
done
~~~

I would like to add some additional specifications below.
- Add a help option using `argparse`.
- Add docstrings and type hints.
- Accept a TXT file as an argument of the script without an option flag. 
- Add an option to specify the output filename.
- Output the text to stdout if there is no specified output filename.
- Suggest some potential filenames for the script.
- Ask "(y)es/(n)o" before overwriting an existing file (default: no). 
- Add the following shebang.
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Here is the rewritten script in Python3. It includes all the requested specifications.

### Suggested Filenames for the Script
- `count_ai_filtered.py`
- `count_ai_html.py`
- `ai_word_counter.py`

This script will process the input TXT file, search for HTML files in the directories specified, and count occurrences of "AI" while excluding the specified words. It will prompt the user for overwriting an existing output file and will either save the output to a file or print it to stdout if no output filename is provided. Let me know if you need additional modifications!

- Add an option to show the lines with "AI" which means "artificial intelligence".
- Output the text to stdout if there is no specified output filename.

## Assistant (gpt-4o)

### Potential Filenames for the Script
1. `count_ai_html.py`
2. `filter_ai_html.py`
3. `ai_word_counter.py`

This script now:
- Implements the exclusion list for specific words.
- Accepts a directory argument and optional output filename.
- Includes a help option using `argparse`.
- Outputs text to stdout or a specified file, with overwrite confirmation for existing files.
- Offers the option to display filtered lines containing "AI."

## User

Please update the following code to exclude the words above:

~~~ 1_count_words_2024_1221.sh 
#!/bin/bash
for i in {2000..2024}; do
    cd "html_${i}"
    echo -n "$i,"
    grep "AI" *.html
    cd -
done
~~~

## Assistant (gpt-4o)

Here’s the updated script to exclude the specified words:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {2000..2024}; do
    cd "html_${i}"
    echo -n "$i,"
    grep "AI" *.html | grep -v -E "(SAILS|WebAIM|CampusEAI|MAIS|Kuali|FAIT|RAI|SAIT|FAE|NAIR|AIMS|HAIL|AIR|CFAIT|FAIM|SAIR|PAIR)"
    cd -
done
```

### Explanation of Updates:
1. **Added `grep -v -E`:** This excludes lines containing any of the listed words.
2. **Regular Expression (`-E`):** The list of words is added as a pipe-separated string `word1|word2|...` to exclude any matches.

If additional exclusions are needed or the logic should be further refined, feel free to ask!
